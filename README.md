# 21-projects

All of those tasks were solved by me while studying at Coding school 21 in Moscow (Ecole 42).  


Ex00 is called eval_expr. The function (eval_expr) takes a characterâ€™s string as an argument. This string represents an arithmetic expression. Five following operations are supported: addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, modulo. Also using amount of brackets is ok. 

Get_next_line allow you to read a line ending with a newline character from a file descriptor. That project also gains a deeper understanding of allocations, whether they happen on the stack memory or in the heap memory, the manipulation and the life cycle of a buffer, the unexpected complexity implied in the use of one or many static variables. The function has no memory leaks, all heap-allocated memory space is properly freed. By the way, I used my libft functions in that project (21-projects/get_next_line/libft/).

Sdeidre (also known as "Fillit") - This program will take a file as a parameter, which contains a list of Tetriminos(A Tetriminos is a 4-blocks geometric figure you probably already heard of because of popular game Tetris), and arrange them in order to create the smallest square possible. The program finds the smallest square in a minimal amount of time, despite an exponentially growing number of possibilities each time a piece is added. I made that in a collaboration with my teammate Bcharman

Ft_ls still is not finished :(
